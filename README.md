# Strain Induced Crystallization (SIC)
Determining why during ultrasonic welding of thermoplastics there is higher crystallinity at weld interfaces with higher amplitudes of vibration.

Determining crystallinity:
S2 nematic order parameter will be calculated to check overall crystallinity. GIXStapose shall be used to check diffraction patterns for further analysis of crystallization.

Simulating ultrasonic welding:
Changing box sizes to simulate localized stretching in the thermoplastics due to being hit by a jig.
